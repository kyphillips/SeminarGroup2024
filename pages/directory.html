				<center><h4>What I do</h4></center>
				<p style="text-align:center;">Hello campers! I am Sarah, and I am in charge of summer camp lodging here at Wayne. As I'm sure you know, the school
					has several dorms for students to live in throughout the year, and this is the same for the summer campers. I coordinate 
					with Residence Life to get you in a room with a roommate that is in the same camp, such as music or sports. This is to 
					ensure that you make connections with those of similar interests as you, as well as making you have similar schedules 
					so that one person does not disturb the other with a late or early practice or something of that nature. I also make sure
					that maintenance cleans your room, as well as making sure that all necessary furniture, a desk, a wardrobe, and a bed are in 
					the room when you arrive.  </p>
